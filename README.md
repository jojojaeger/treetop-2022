# Treetop Challenge 1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.4.
It is splitted into four components: 
- list for showing all the components
- detail view for showing the details of one component 
- form for adding a new treetop component

Also routing was used for navigating between pages, a compoment-factory for mocking the data and a component-service for simulating the database (get data, push data,..). Data will be gone however after refreshing the page. 

## MODULES

Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies. For this project bootstrap as a style library was used.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
